# 🏔️ MOSD  
## Manifestor's Operating System Development

MOSD is a technology collective dedicated to pushing the boundaries of system engineering through low-level software solutions. Our vision is to merge the raw power of hardware with the elegance of modern software architecture, guided by an authoritative and uncompromising design philosophy.

We focus on **operating systems**, **high-performance drivers**, and **compiler technologies**, aiming to build software that directly controls the system rather than hiding behind excessive abstractions.

## 🚀 Projects

### BergOS
A modern, GPU-accelerated desktop operating system built on top of the Haiku kernel.

BergOS combines the safety and clarity of Swift with the legendary responsiveness and agility of BeOS.

**Highlights:**
- Low-latency system architecture  
- GPU-accelerated modern desktop environment  
- System-level integration with Swift  

---

### BergOS Swift Library (SystemKit)
The core framework that bridges BergOS kernel and system components with Swift.

**Goals:**
- Direct access to operating system components  
- Fine-grained control over performance and memory  
- Safe yet unrestricted system-level programming  

---

### BergOS Swift Compiler
A native Swift compilation toolchain specifically optimized for the BergOS ecosystem.

**Features:**
- Native performance-focused compilation  
- Optimizations tailored for system programming  
- Deep integration with the BergOS runtime

## 🧭 Philosophy

> “You cannot control a system you do not understand.”

MOSD prioritizes fundamentals over convenience and treats abstractions as tools, not goals.
